## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Build the executable:
   - On Windows:
     - Open a powershell and navigate to the project directory
     - Set the execution policy by typing the following command and pressing A to accept all: "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"
     - Execute the powershell script by typing the following command: ".\\build_windows.ps1"   
   - On Linux:
     - Just execute: "stack build"
3. Run the project by typing: "stack exec vsynth-exe"

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
The Glasgow Haskell Compiler - ghc
Stack
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
